#### Process for Listing

Homeowners who create a profile on Raha can directly list their properties by providing the following details:
- Title: A descriptive title for the property.
- Description: A detailed description of the property, including unique features and attractions.
- Photos: At least four high-quality photos showcasing different areas of the property.
- Location: The exact location of the property.
- Amenities: A list of amenities available at the property (e.g., Wi-Fi, parking, swimming pool).
- Characteristics: All relevant characteristics of the property (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, type of property).

Homeowners can list multiple properties if they have more than one available for rent. Currently, there are no additional requirements for listing properties, but this may change in future versions of the app.

### 4.2 Booking Process

#### How Clients Book Properties

Clients can browse available properties on the Raha app. When a client finds a property they like, they can initiate the booking process by clicking the "Book" button.
- The client specifies the desired booking period.
- The homeowner receives a notification with the booking request details, including the client's phone number.
- The homeowner contacts the client to confirm the booking period and arrange for a portion of the rental fee to be sent via CCP or BaridiMob.
- Once the homeowner and client agree, the homeowner confirms the booking in the app. The property is then marked as booked for the specified period.

#### Communication Between Homeowners and Clients

Communication between homeowners and clients primarily occurs through direct contact (phone call) as provided in the booking request notification. Homeowners and clients are encouraged to discuss and confirm all details related to the booking during this communication.

#### Confirmation and Cancellation

The booking is confirmed once the homeowner marks it as booked in the app after agreeing with the client. Cancellation policies are determined by the homeowner and should be communicated to the client during the booking process. Any changes or cancellations should be promptly updated in the app to reflect the current availability.

### 4.3 Commission Fees

#### Fee Structure

Raha charges a commission fee of 5% of the rental fee for each booking made through the app. Homeowners are required to send the 5% commission to Raha via CCP or BaridiMob to ensure their property remains listed and visible in the app.

#### First Month Free

The first month of using the Raha app is free for homeowners, meaning no commission fees are charged for bookings made during this period. After the first month, the 5% commission fee applies to all subsequent bookings.

### 4.4 Payment Methods

#### Accepted Payment Methods

The accepted payment methods for transactions on Raha are:
- CCP (Compte Chèque Postal)
- BaridiMob (an Algerian mobile payment service)

#### Payment Process

Once a booking is confirmed, the homeowner and client arrange for a portion of the rental fee to be sent via CCP or BaridiMob. Homeowners are required to send the 5% commission fee to Raha via CCP or BaridiMob to ensure continued visibility of their property on the app.
